Network security (Network Security) is a computer network is one thing that is very important to monitor network access and prevent misuse of the illegal network.

OSI model reference of open networks or OSI Model References for open networking is a network architectural model developed by the agency the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in Europe in 1977. OSI itself is an acronym for Open Systems Interconnection. This model is also called the model "OSI seven layer model".

Similarities between the OSI model with TCP / IP

1. Each model uses a layered structure in explaining the data communication process.
2. Had the application layer, although there are differences in the function of the layer.
3. Each has a transport layer and the internet (network).
4. Each uses packet-switched technology in its data packet transmission. Packet-Switched technique is a method of sending data packets. The data packets can take the path (path) different addresses in achieving a common goal.

The difference between the OSI model with TCP / IP

1. OSI 7 layer has a layer, and TCP / IP only has 4 Layer.
2. TCP / IP layer is the "Specific Protocol", while OSI Layer is Protocol Independen.3.
3. The top layer of the OSI layers, namely application, presentation, and session represented into 1 layer Layer TCP / IP, that layer.
4. All the standard that is used in TCP / IP networks can be obtained secaracuma charge of the various computers in the Internet, unlike the OSI.
5. Development of the ISO / OSI faltered not like TCP / IP.
6. For the long term, the possibility of TCP / IP will become standard networked world, unlike the OSI.
7. OSI developed a model based on theory, whereas TCPmengembangkan model after it has been implemented.
8. TCP / IP combines the presentation and session layer in the OSI applicationlayer.
9. TCP / IP combines the data link and physical layers into a single layer OSI.
10. TCP / IP is simple with 4 layers.
11. TCP / IP is more credible because of protocol. No network is built with the OSI protocol, even though everyone uses the OSI model to guide their thoughts.

So it can be concluded that the OSI Layer is a basic concept in network security. So here we know that the parts and functions well at OSI Layer on layer and TCP / IP. It explains that the TCP / IP which we know is very vulnerable to attack because their security is not so strong.
