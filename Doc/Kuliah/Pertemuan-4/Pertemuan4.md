Background

We may be familiar with the network, either via smartphone or komputer.Terutama that is often associated with a username and password activity eg email, social media, e-banking, etc. Perhaps you are wondering what to do with your username and password.Saya sniffing will explain my knowledge of sniffing.

Discussion

Sniffing What is it?

sniffing is the practice of reading the IP packets from one node to another node. The method used in sniffing is a method of intercepting, which the hacker network will enter into the path of data packets through the target.
Data traveling on the network to flow back and forth will be captured by using sniffing sometimes describes the contents of a request for comment or other specifications. When viewed from the structure of the network, several parties can tap a whole or any of the traffic division of one of the machines in the network. Network control devices can also be set by an application or tool tapper to work at random or random.
There are several ways to avoid the use of sniffing tool by others. One way that can be used for avoiding sniffing is to increase our network security system. For example by changing the HTTP to HTTPS. With HTTPS can encrypt the data that we had with using AES or higher again. The higher the encryption of the data we have, the more difficult sniffer intercepting packet data we have so much safer.

Conclusions and recommendations

So, the conclusion by sniffing we can figure out a log or trace data such as username and password.

My suggestion to be more wise in the use of sniffing do not there is disadvantaged.
