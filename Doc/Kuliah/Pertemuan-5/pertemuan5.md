Background

Many of us may have heard the term IP Spoofing, but sometimes we do not know more details about the IP Spoffing ini.Mungkin we've become one of the victims of this Spoffing IP. Okay here I will explain a little of my knowledge about this spoofing.

Discussion

Spoofing is a method to hide IP address by creating the IP packets that contain fake IP address to the victim so that the victim will follow the fake address. IP Spoofing is used to insert false information to the victim so that the victim can not be lost to the fake IP.

As for the destination IP Spoofing someone doing that is:

Sending spam in large numbers so that the victim's computer will experience overload.
Trick the victim's computer so that the victim thought that the package is a package that can be trusted.
there are several types of spoofing include:

Arp Spoofing is a technique in which wiretapping by a third party that the victim is tricked by a fake mac address that we gave to the victims, thereby stopping the communication traffic Atar two machines connected in a network.
DNS Spoofing is one method of hacking Man In The Middle Attack. the concept is similar to Arp Spoofing but that distinguishes that the attacker will forge the IP address of a domain.
Once we know the definition and types of spoofing incomplete if we do not discuss how to prevent the spoofing.

1. Prevent web spoofing ways to do that:

do not turn on javascript in your browser so that the attacker can not hide evidence of the attack.
turn off the location line of the browser.
see the URL displayed in the browser's location line of the URL to make sure it is referring to the server from the actual site.
2. Preventing DNS spoofing ways to do that:

DNS spoofing can be mitigated by disabling recursive queries to the name server by creating a split DNS name server that makes two. Name the main server can be used to handle the domain name of the public domain, while the second name server that is in the internal network served as a cache name server on duty to answer queries from the user requesting the domain.

3. Prevent ARP Spoofing ways to do that:

Checked the MAC Address by using the tools Colasoft MAC Scanner.
Scan the network, if there are two pieces of the same IP Address Gateway broke up the client on the network and then scan Virus using antivirus up-to-date virus database.
After virus scanning, do step this cover, open the Command prom type: arp -s mac_address_gateway ip_address_gateway then press Enter.
4. Prevent IP Spoofing ways to do that:

Installing the filter in router by exploiting "Ingress and egress filtering" on the router is the first step in defending themselves from spoofing.
 In addition to encryption and Authenfikasi we can resolve IP Spoofing with mengiplementasikan authentication and data encryption.
Conclusions and recommendations

So, the conclusion spoofing is a process of giving a false address to the victim so that the victim can follow the fake address.

advice to always beware of a website address, we can minimize the actors spoofing the way we view the certificate from the web.
