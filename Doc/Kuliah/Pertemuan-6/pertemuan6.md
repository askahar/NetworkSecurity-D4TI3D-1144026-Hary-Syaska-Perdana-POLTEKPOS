Background

At this meeting we will discuss about Denial Of Service (DOS). Maybe some of us are familiar with the usual DOS.DOS done by hackers as a means of last resort in the hacking technique that experienced server down.

Discussion

DOS (Denial Of Service) is a last way a hacker can do if he did not manage to penetrate the system to make the server busy by the request that we sent so the server itself could not serve another request.

In conducting the request normally hacker is not doing itself but a way to ask a friend by sending the IP, as if he was doing it yourself might need some programs run so it will consume a lot of RAM. It is also known as DDOS (Distributed Denial Of Service).

Working system of this DDOS is made so that the server is down in serving the demand of the client, because the server has a maximum limit in response to client perminttan done. So we sent a request as much as possible to the maximum extent so that the server can experience down. When the server is unable to serve requests from the client it is called the "denied"

Prevention, perhaps to now there is no way to prevent it. But there are ways to minimize this is to:

Improving the capacity of service if an attacker or hacker did not increase the capacity demand.
IP blocking attackers or hackers through the firewall.
Incorporate all IP attacker inside the firewall.
Make Honey Pot.
Conclusions and recommendations

So, the conclusion is that the DDOS is one last way when the attacker can not penetrate a system, but the attacker will conduct direct attack on the server so that the server is down. When the server down dpat not make server requests from clients that make the process be denied.
