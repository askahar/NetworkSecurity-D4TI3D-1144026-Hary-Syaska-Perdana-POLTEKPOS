Background

In the networked world as we know there may be no network is completely secure 100% .It makes us worry about whether our data safe from hacker attacks or not? Hacker itself has a wide variety of ways in order to penetrate the security and also access the network freely.

The hackers have the anatomy of hacking as a cardinal rule in order to make hacking.oke here I'll explain a little my knowledge of anatomy hacking.

Discussion

Anatomy Hacking is the steps that are used gradually in the process of hacking. In addition to attacking the hacking, hacking anatomy can also be used as a defender to face attacks from hackers others. The measures in question are:

1. Reconnaissance
Reconnaissance is the stage of collecting data. Here hacker will collect data about the targets in incarnya as much as possible. In conducting the inquiry or the collection of this data, is divided into two parts. Namely Reconnaissance Recconnaisance Active and Passive. Active section where to search data directly so it is very risky, and part Passiveakan do a search or data collection without the knowledge of the target.

2. Scanning
Scanning is a sign of the early start of the attack. In scanning hackers will predict the possibilities that can be used to take over the victim system and the information can be used as an access road.

3. Gaining Access
At this stage, the hacker will immediately penetrate and trying to master the victim of a data network system information obtained when scanning.

4. Maintaining Acces
At this stage, the hacker has successfully mastered the victim's network security system. Here hacker can already free to do anything in the system of the target tissue. But usually to avoid the worst, the hackers will continue to maintain access rights on the network system of their victims in various ways such as implanting a trojan, backdor or other viruses.

5. Clearing Tracks
This stage is a very important stage in the hacking. Because if it is not done, it is not likely the hackers will be caught in action. Yes this stage is the stage of the elimination of the traces left behind. Sometimes hackers left a folder that contains a virus that can not be tracked.


Conclusions and recommendations

Thus, the conclusion that the hacker hacking techniques have a variety of techniques and has steps in doing the hacking of a network.
