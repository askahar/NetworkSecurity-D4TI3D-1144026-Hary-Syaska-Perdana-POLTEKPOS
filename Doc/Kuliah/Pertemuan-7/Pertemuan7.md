Background

At this meeting we will discuss about firewall.Mungkin we often hear about these firewalls, like many people who use the Internet network access, hence the need for the protection of digital data that is held against the attacker. So the role of the firewall becomes very important in network security. Okay we will discuss about this firewall.

Discussion

Firewall is a rule in the Internet network to be forwarded or not the entire IP packet. Generally, a firewall is implemented in a dedicated machine, which runs on a gateway between the local network to the Internet network. Firewall is obliged to use and maintain the level of safety because it will narrow the gap of security commonly used by hackers to break into a system.

There are three main firewall rules are:

Pass, and the sender forwarding IP packets to the destination.
Block, banning IP packets to be forwarded without notification to the sender.
Reject, prohibit packets to be forwarded with the notification.
some criteria that do firewall whether to allow data packets through or not, among other things:

IP address of the destination computer.
IP address of the destination computer.
Port TCP / UDP source of resources.
Port TCP / UDP destination data on the destination computer.
Information from the header that is stored in the data packet.
There are several benefits of a firewall installed on the network are:

The entire access network we can control through the firewall.
Can keep that copy your valuable confidential information out without the knowledge.
Can monitor all services running.
Can record and record all activities running through it.
Can apply a security policy (Security Policy).
Can prevent a package that feels mencurigkan by the system.
Can hinder the movement of the attackers who tried to enter the system.
How a firewall on the computer that is closing ports except for some specific ports that need to be kept open. Firewall has become a line of defense in preventing all kinds of hacking into the network, because when hackers penetrated the first security system that sought, namely an open port that can be accessed.

On the network firewall there are two ways that we can use that network communication can be run in accordance with its function, which uses "packet filtering" and "proxy system"

Configuration of the firewall subject to the discretion of security (Security Policy) which is primarily used, namely Permitted and prohibitted.

Conclusions and recommendations

So, the conclusion is that the firewall is one of the means used to secure the network from hacker attacks, because the firewall closes and opens several ports so as to open or close the port will ask for permission in advance.
